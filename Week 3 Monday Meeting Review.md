2022-03-14

> Good day！～ Sara，Tae，Ann and Tony，Our Sprint 1 Starting now～！

## SRP Sprint 1

>  We have 5 user stories（SRP-2，SRP-9，SRP-10，SRP-11，SRP-12）that we need to do from now to 28 Mar.



**First of all**, I hope everyone have a good weekend and can access Jira now successfully(If you have questions, please let me know).



>  **Our project,Spendie dApp,will be an adaptive website that will work on a mobile.** 



Our homepage of the front-end development will be similar like [quickswap](https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap)![Screen Shot 2022-03-14 at 15.11.07](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/letsgopro/Spendie-dApp-Weekly-Meeting-Review/master/quickswap-Screen%20Shot%202022-03-14%20at%2015.11.07%20copy.png)

**Secondly**, have a look at [Jira Spendie RMIT PoC Software project](https://spendie.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/SRP/boards/3)

Then you should 

**1.**Go through the SRPs(as well as what we learnt call this 'PBIs'), be familiar with the SRP that you are assigned and others. You will find more details and understand each SRP easier when you click on each SRP.

**Finally**, we all have no experience of Vue.js before. So we all need to spend some time on it.



**One more thing**, I think we need to have a short meeting this week to discuss our SRP with our mentor. 



*If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.*
